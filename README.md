The purpose of this webpage is to create a daily schedule. <br>
When the user opens the page, the first thing they see is the title, the header, and the current date.<br>
Underneath that, they see time blocks from 9am to 5pm.<br>
Each time block is color coded so that past time blocks, present time blocks, and future time blocks can be differentiated easily.<br>
The user can edit the text boxes to schedule anything from to-do lists to appointments and meetings.<br>
Clicking the save button will save the entered information to local storage so that the user's schedule is there even if they close the page.<br>
