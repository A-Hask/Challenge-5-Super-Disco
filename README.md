The purpose of this webpage is to create a daily schedule.
When the user opens the page, the first thing they see is the title and the current date.
Underneath that, they see time blocks from 9am to 5pm.
Each time block is color coded so that past time blocks, present time blocks, and future time blocks can be differentiated easily.
The user can edit the text boxes to schedule anything from to-do lists to appointments and meetings.
Clicking the save button will save the entered information to local storage so that the user's schedule is there even if they close the page.
